- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @galizia, Neuroscience Group in Insect Olfaction at the University of Konstanz, Germany.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in olfactory coding of the insect brain, calcium imaging, neuroscience, learning and memory.
We develop tools for calcium imaging, and a reporsitory for olfactory receptor response profiles.

The DoOR Database is here on gitHub,
and pyVIEW, a program for evaluating calcium imaging data, optimized for the analysis of odorant evoked activity patterns.
